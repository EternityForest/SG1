# RFM69 Library

This is a library for secure-ish(Think cheap Bluetooth lock, not bank grade)
encrypted communications with RFM69.

Work in progress, currently I have Golay code error correction
dynamic TX power control, encryption and authentication,
and a decent API that still lets you transmit and recieve
raw packets if you need to.
